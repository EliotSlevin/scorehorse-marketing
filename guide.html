		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<p>The idea setup for scorehorse will have the following;</p>

		<div class="steps">
			<p><span class="circle">1.</span>Make the league for a calendar month. We suggest 6 players per league, so people will have mostly one Scorehorse game a week. Easy to remember you have to play your games in the month.</p>
			
			<p><span class="circle">2.</span>Email ( mailchimp is a brilliant group email app we suggest] all the players once a week with a reminder to book their games, and anything else you want to let them know about. Monday morning while people are fresh is a good time.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">3.</span>Have a couple of sponsored prizes that people who play all their games go in the drawer for- encourages players to play all their games.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">4.</span>Another good lucky drawer prize is a coaching voucher.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">5.</span>Be constantly filling up the sideline during the month. Put them in order, so they are easy to organise. Put the league they want to go in, and the month.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">6.</span>Find a sponsor to have a banner add on your Scorehorse page, to at least cove the monthly fee.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">7.</span>Personalise the colours of Scorehorse to fit your club. We can help with that.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">8.</span>Ditto with getting Scorehorse embedded into your website.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">9.</span>Just before the end of the month email all players saying they need to get back to you BEFORE the end of the month if they want out- when they want back in, if they are badly in the wrong league etc.</p>

			<p><span class="circle">10.</span>On the first day of the next month, do a DRAFT of the next league, send it out to the players and asks them to check it for any errors. Say you will confirm the league by 12 on the 2nd. The next day after any changes mail a link to the confirmed leagues, with a list of any prize winners etc.</p>
